Xeus-CPP is a successor of Xeus-Clang-Repl and Xeus-Cling. It is a Jupyter
kernel for C++, based on native implementation of the Jupyter protocol 'Xeus'.
This enables users to write and execute their C++ code interactively, where
they can see the results immediately. Its REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
mechanism allows for rapid prototyping and iterations without the overhead of
compiling and running separate C++ programs. 

Following are some interesting use cases for Xeus-CPP:

- Experiment with C++ and Python integration within the same Jupyter
  environment.

- Identify and resolve issues in small code snippets while isolating and
  testing specific pieces of your code.

- Practice C++ in an interactive yet controlled environment.

- Etc.

> Tip: Jupyter notebooks support magic commands (%%python) and inline code
> execution for various languages. You can use these features to run Python
> and C++ code in separate cells to accomplish interactive communication
> between them.

### C++-Python Integration Example

In this example, we are emphasizing the concept of Python-C++ integration,
where we use Python and C++ in the same session, sharing variables, scopes,
and features. 

![Integration Tutorial](/images/blog/2024-01-31-xeus-cpp-image-1.webp){: style="{{ image_style }}"}

Here, we have used variables (new_var1, new_var2, new_var3) in python which
have been initialised in C++. In the following context, we have tried the vice
versa as well of using the variables in Python (new_python_var) which have
been defined in C++.

For detailed instructions, please visit this [tutorial].

### Feature Roadmap

Our goal is to advance the project's feature support to the extent of whatâ€™s
supported in Xeus-Clang-Repl and Xeus-Cling. If you'd like to contribute to
Xeus-CPP's under-development features like Value Printing, advancing the WASM
infrastructure, etc., please visit the [Open Projects] page and the
[Contributing Guide].
